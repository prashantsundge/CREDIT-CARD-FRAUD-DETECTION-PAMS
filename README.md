Introduction
Welcome to the [Project Name] repository! This project focuses on exploring and improving the performance of classification models using a pre-processed dataset. The dataset has already undergone Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, eliminating the need for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Standard scaling has been applied, and two classification algorithms, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors, have been employed on the imbalanced dataset.
